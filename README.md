This project is a web application built using React and Next.js that displays information about a fictional business called Enigma. It includes several pages with information about the business, a contact form, and a store page where users can browse and purchase products. The store page uses a context API to manage the user's cart and display the number of items in the cart in the navbar. The application also includes a Three.js canvas on the homepage that renders a rotating cube with fog and lighting effects. The website is styled using CSS modules and responsive design techniques to ensure it looks good on different screen sizes.
